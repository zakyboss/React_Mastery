      // Why DO We Need FrameWorks , why not build with Just Plain JS
      // Back in the day websites were rendered on the server
      // JQUERY was used in the past

      // Now it is client side rendered
      // They are now called single Web Application
      // Data is consumed by API  to produce effect

      // The most important task of single webpage application is to keep the UI
      // in sync with the data and displays current state of Data

      //  *************Reasons why you cant use Plain JS **********
      // 1.Requires a lot of dom Traversing and creates tangled up and spaghetti code
      // 2. Data (state) usually stored in the DOM ,shared across the entire application and can be manipulated by any state
      // making it hard to debug

      // **************Why do Front-end Frameworks exist *********
      //   Keeping A user interface in Sync with Data is really hard and a lot of work
      // Keeping a structured way to build code
      // Give developers and teams consistent way of building data
