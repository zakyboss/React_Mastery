As Per Now I have learnt 
     1. React importing through 'react'
     2.React Dom importing through 'react-dom/client'
     3.Component function creation (The first letter Capitalized and must return JSX - If more than one element is being return we have to use a container i.e Div or something)
     4. Inline style using style = {{backgroundColor:'green'}}
     5.Including Some JS logic using {}
     6. Conditionally rendering using && operator or Ternary operator(You can setup using if else that conditionally return this JSX or another)
     7.Using props to dynamically render individual elements of the same type but different content
     8.Looping through array contents using Map method
     9.Destructuring Props using {somethigHere};
     10.React fragment - Incase you want to return something outside the main Div or element (<> </> or <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment)
