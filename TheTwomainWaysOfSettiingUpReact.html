        // There are 2 Main Ways Setting Up React ;
                //  1. Create-react-app method 
       // NB //This method is advised against for full scale market ready applications because it has 
    //    slow Refresh time 

                    //   2.Vite 
        // Vite is preffered for fullscale projects because it has fast refresh times 
        // Page refreshes and updates immediately
